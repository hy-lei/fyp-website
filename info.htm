			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>In recent years, Hong Kong government has planned to make the city more intelligent, and traffic is one of its main focus. As the gateway to mainland China and a crucial financial hub in Asia-Pacific region, Hong Kong bear enormous amount of traffic on a daily basis. According to Hong Kong Transport Department, about 780,000 vehicles are currently running in the city, which is a significant figure compared with its road length of 2,101 kilometers [1]. Such a large vehicle base and limited road capacity requires more efficient use and allocation of transport resources. Additionally, the large traffic flow happening in Hong Kong produces a significant number of incidents and retards the traffic by a large extent.</p>
			<p>At present, incidents on the road is monitored by Traffic Control Center, and the process is manual. A large incident management system, with algorithms automatically detecting traffic incidents, will free more manpower and make the incident monitoring process more efficacious. An accurate incident detection system can not only benefit Transport Department on traffic management such as traffic flow control by making use of police power and intelligent traffic lights, but also helps individual traffic participants to have a more accurate estimation on the travel time.</p>

			<h2>Objective</h2>
			<p>In this project, we aim to find an optimal algorithm allowing accurate detection of traffic incidents. To meet such a goal, we will explore, devise, implement and test algorithms that are suitable to the nature of Hong Kong traffic data. We will then select the optimal algorithm according to several metrics: mean time to detect, false alarm rate, and detection rate.</p>
			<p>The intermediate objective for the project is to develop a demo showcasing how an incident detection algorithm works, preferably with visualization aid such as a web page. In this demo, we will demonstrate a use case where an incident happens and gets detected.</p>
			<p>The final goal for the project is to provide a report offering an optimal algorithm for incident detection, and an exhaustive analysis discussing how it fits the nature of Hong Kong traffic condition.</p>
