	<p>As reported in the latest Hong Kong government plans, there is a pressing need for Hong Kong to be an intelligent city. Towards this goal, this project aims to design incident management algorithms and system for Hong Kong. The main purpose of this system is to automatically detect any emergency incident that happens on the roads (e.g., car accidents, broken water pipes, other events such as football matches and protests blocking roads). The system should alert drivers and providing alternative routing suggestions to them. The system will require the study and use of advanced AI and machine learning algorithms (e.g., neural networks). We have collected some traffic data in Hong Kong (e.g., speed data of different districts of Hong Kong, as well as taxi data).</p>
